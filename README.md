### Project Title

Granular-Ball Based Label Noise Correction for Robust Sentiment Analysis

### Project Overview

Sentiment analysis plays an important role in public opinion analysis, personalized recommendations, and other areas. However, due to the inherent ambiguity of sentiments, it often faces the challenge of noisy labels. Currently, there is relatively little research focused on correcting noisy labels. This paper proposes a new method called Granular-Ball based Enhanced Sentiment Analysis (GBLC) to address the problem of label noise in sentiment analysis tasks. To meet different application needs, two versions of the method are proposed: GBLC Prime and GBLC Simplified, balancing computational efficiency and accuracy. Experimental evaluations on multiple datasets (including SST, Amazon, Yelp, and IMDB) show that GBLC outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques in both noise correction and sentiment classification accuracy, especially in high-noise environments. The proposed method shows great potential for improving the reliability of sentiment analysis applications across various domains.
